Black box -> familiar with **UI** but we don't know how code works
    (E2E, API testing)

Grey box -> familiar with **UI** and validation based on written code.
    (E2E, API testing)

White box -> Understand code and write Unit Testing and Integration testing.


UI - user interface
UX - user experience
