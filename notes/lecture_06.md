## 1. Repeat and check homework


## 2. Testing levels 

1. Unit testing
2. Integration testing
3. System testing
4. E2E / UAT (User Acceptance Testing)
   1. Alfa
   2. Beta

## 3. FE/BE
![](/pictures/fe_be.png)

FE - frontend
BE - backend

Client-Server architecture
Client(FE), Server (BE)

Monolithic vs Microservice architectures.

UI - User Interface
API - Application Programming Interface
CLI - Command Line Interface


## 4. Boxing
![](/pictures/back_vs_white_image.png)

Black boxing:  
- require FE & BE (UI/UX)  
- E2E / UAT  
- System testing require API and documentation  

Grey boxing:  
- E2E / UAT / System testing  
- we understand validation based on written code  

White boxing:  
- unite and integration testing
- require part of code.

## 5. Software dev. methodologies: Waterfall, Agile

SDLC - software Development life cycle  
STLC - software Testing life cycle  

Requirements:
1. Customer requirements
2. System requirements
3. Programming specification 

PO - project owner / product owner

Waterfall: Linear and sequential. Each phase (e.g., Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testnig → Maintenance) must be completed before the next begins.

Agile: Iterative and incremental. Development is done in small cycles (sprints), and features are delivered continuously.

Testing
> Waterfall: Testing happens after development is complete.  
> Agile: Testing happens continuously during dev
